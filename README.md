# clerk-turso-webhook-handler
This project is a Go-based webhook handler that listens for organization creation events from Clerk and automatically creates corresponding child databases in Turso. It sets up a web server to receive webhook payloads, parses the event data, and interacts with Turso to manage database creation.
